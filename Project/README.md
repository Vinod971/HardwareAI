# Hardware-AI Accelerator Project

This repository hosts the HDL design and verification environment for a simplified hardware implementation of a DeepSpeech-like neural architecture. The focus is on developing key components such as MFCC preprocessing, ReLU activation, and an LSTM-based sequential inference engine using Verilog/SystemVerilog.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how speech recognition processing (similar to Mozilla‚Äôs DeepSpeech) can be mapped onto a hardware accelerator. The system performs:

- Matrix multiplication of MFCC features with a weight matrix.
- Non-linearity using ReLU activation.
- Sequential modeling using LSTM logic.

Key modules:
- `TopDeepSpeech.sv`: Integrates all processing stages (MFCC √ó Weights ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí LSTM).
- FSM control logic for load, compute, and finalization phases.
- Internal approximations of `sigmoid` and `tanh`.
