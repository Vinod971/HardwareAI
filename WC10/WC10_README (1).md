## ðŸ§  Memristor Simulation

**Files**:
- `memres.py`: Python script simulating the electrical behavior of a memristor device.
- `memristor_simulation_report.pdf`: A detailed report on the setup, simulation results, and findings.

**Description**:
- The simulation models memristive dynamics, possibly using differential equations or behavioral logic.
- Report provides theoretical background and results analysis.

**How to Run**:
```bash
python memres.py
```

**Platform Recommendation**:
- Local Python environment or Google Colab.
