Matrix Multiplication (Parallel Implementation)

Overview This implementation performs matrix multiplication in parallel. The parallelization is done by splitting the work across rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix. The following steps outline the approach:

Input Validation:

First, check if the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. If not, matrix multiplication is not possible, and an error message will be generated.
Matrix Splitting:

Split the first matrix into rows and the second matrix into columns.
Parallel Computation:

Perform the multiplication of each row of the first matrix with each column of the second matrix in parallel.
Summation:

Sum the results of the multiplications to get the elements of the result matrix.
Result Placement:

Place the computed values into the appropriate positions in the result matrix.
Parallelization Approach
Rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix are split into separate tasks.
Each task multiplies corresponding elements and adds them together to calculate the result of that position in the result matrix.
Example

Letâ€™s consider two matrices:

Matrix A (2x3): 1 2 3 4 5 6

Matrix B (3x2):

7 8 9 10 11 12

To perform matrix multiplication:

The number of columns of A (3) must be equal to the number of rows of B (3). Since both are equal, multiplication is possible.
The result matrix C (2x2) will be calculated by multiplying rows of A with columns of B:

Result C:

C[0][0] = (17) + (29) + (311) = 7 + 18 + 33 = 58 C[0][1] = (18) + (210) + (312) = 8 + 20 + 36 = 64 C[1][0] = (47) + (59) + (611) = 28 + 45 + 66 = 139 C[1][1] = (48) + (510) + (612) = 32 + 50 + 72 = 154

So, the resulting matrix C will be:

58 64 139 154

Parallel Execution

The multiplication of each element in the resulting matrix is done in parallel, which speeds up the computation. Each multiplication and summation of elements for a specific position in the result matrix is handled by separate threads or processes.
