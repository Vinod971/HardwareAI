# WC2 - Week 2 Challenges

## Challenge 3: Matrix Multiplication Optimization

**Description**:  
Implement and optimize matrix multiplication using different algorithms and compare their performance.

**How to Run**:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
   - Install required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Execution**:
   - Navigate to the WC2 directory:
     ```bash
     cd WC2
     ```
   - Run the main script:
     ```bash
     python matrix_multiplication.py
     ```

**Expected Output**:
- Performance metrics for each matrix multiplication algorithm.

**Platform Recommendation**:
- Local Machine preferred for performance benchmarking.
