## ðŸ§® Matrix Computation Notebook

**File**:
- `Matrix.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing matrix operations or a related algorithm.

**How to Run**:

1. Open in Jupyter Lab or Google Colab:
   - [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Vinod971/HardwareAI/blob/main/WC8/Matrix.ipynb) 

2. Alternatively, run locally:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Matrix.ipynb
   ```

**Platform Recommendation**:
- Google Colab for ease and GPU support (if needed)
- Jupyter Notebook for local execution

---

Ensure Python 3.8+ and install `numpy`, `matplotlib`, or other required packages as specified in the notebook.
