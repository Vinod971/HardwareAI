# DeepSpeech AI

Welcome to **DeepSpeech AI**, a comprehensive project exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and hardware acceleration. This repository is organized into weekly challenges (WC1–WC10), each delving into key concepts like matrix computation, CUDA programming, neural networks, and digital hardware design.

## 🧠 Project Vision

**DeepSpeech AI** aims to bridge the gap between AI theory and efficient hardware implementation. Through hands-on experiments and simulations, this project equips students and researchers with practical experience in:
- Parallel and GPU programming
- AI algorithm implementation
- Hardware design with SystemVerilog
- Memristor and neuromorphic computing
- Performance benchmarking and analysis
